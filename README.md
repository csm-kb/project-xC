# Project xC, by Spectre
A project that informed the design of a relatively simple and expandable 64-bit CPU architecture and assembly instruction language.

The xC assembler and 'spectre' CPU-equipped virtual machine in this repository are written in Python 3.8, in an attempt to emulate those components.

Note that 'Gabe Svolenka', "the original creator and director of the project (including its implementation)", is merely an alias referring to a fictional character in a programming puzzle game idea that inspired this project.

## xC assembly instructions
- [ ] todo
## 'spectre' CPU architecture overview
- [ ] todo

## todo list
- [ ] refactor the entire assembler, now that I have written a better-structured one for the [Hack assembler](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project06) :D
